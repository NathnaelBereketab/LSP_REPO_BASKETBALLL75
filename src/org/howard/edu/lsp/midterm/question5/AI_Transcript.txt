AI Usage Transcript During Midterm Exam

Student: "I need help understanding Arthur Riel's heuristics for analyzing class cohesion. I'm looking at the StudentPortalHelper class and need to determine if it has high or low cohesion."

AI: "Arthur Riel's heuristics focus on whether a class has a single, well-defined responsibility. Look for classes where methods share common data and work toward a unified purpose. The StudentPortalHelper class appears to handle multiple unrelated responsibilities like GPA calculation, file I/O, email formatting, and payment processing, which suggests low cohesion."

Student: "Can you help me verify my AreaCalculator formulas? I want to make sure my circle area calculation using Math.PI * radius * radius is correct."

AI: "Yes, that formula is correct. For a circle, area = π × r². Your implementation using Math.PI * radius * radius follows the standard formula. Make sure to handle the IllegalArgumentException for radius ≤ 0."

Student: "I'm confused about the car manufacturer UML question. Why doesn't inheritance support dynamic trim-level changes?"

AI: "Inheritance creates a fixed 'is-a' relationship at compile time. Once a car object is created as a Base, Sports, or Luxury class, its type cannot change at runtime. Java doesn't allow changing an object's class after instantiation. This is why composition with interfaces would be better for dynamic behavior."

Student: "For the smart campus device system, how do I properly implement multiple interfaces? My DoorLock needs to implement both Networked and BatteryPowered."

AI: "In Java, you can implement multiple interfaces by separating them with commas: 'public class DoorLock extends Device implements Networked, BatteryPowered'. Make sure to implement all methods from both interfaces and call super(id, location) in your constructor."

Student: "Can you help me understand why Device should be abstract rather than a concrete class?"

AI: "Device is abstract because it provides common functionality (id, location, heartbeat) that all devices share, but each device type needs its own specific getStatus() implementation. This follows the template method pattern where common behavior is defined in the abstract class, but specific behavior is left to subclasses."

Student: "I'm working on the AreaCalculator Main class. Can you help me format the output to match exactly what's required? I need the exact string format for the circle, rectangle, triangle, and square outputs."

AI: "Make sure your output strings match exactly: 'Circle radius 3.0 → area = ' + result, 'Rectangle 5.0 x 2.0 → area = ' + result, etc. The arrow symbol (→) and spacing are important for the exact format."

Student: "For the Thermostat class, do I need to implement the BatteryPowered interface or just Networked?"

AI: "Looking at the requirements, Thermostat only implements Networked, not BatteryPowered. Only DoorLock and Camera implement BatteryPowered. Thermostat just needs the temperature field and Networked methods."

Student: "Can you help me understand the difference between multiple inheritance and multiple interface implementation in Java?"

AI: "Java doesn't support multiple inheritance for classes (you can only extend one class), but you can implement multiple interfaces. This is interface-based composition, not multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance would mean extending multiple classes, which Java doesn't allow."
